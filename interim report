#### PREAMBLE : ## Clearing mem buffers ####

#Import Data
data <- "credit data.csv"
credit_data <- fread(data) 

#Q2.a) What is the data you are looking at? Where did you get it from? Is it analyzable / what did you do to make it analyzable?


#Q2.b)What variables are in your data – a summary description (like the table describing the chimera dataset in the assignments). 
#If you have a large data set, only include those variables that are relevant


#Q2.c) Preliminary Analysis – show me the summary statistics of the relevant variables, a correlation table, 
#any plots or figures that you think show some insight into the data? (don’t need to include everything, just what you consider relevant)

#Q2.d) What are your hypotheses/modeling approach, or what analyses are you going to conduct - what is the DV, what is the IV? 
#Are there any controls or interactions? Are you using LOGIT or OLS or LASSO or CART?


#Q2.e) anything else?
